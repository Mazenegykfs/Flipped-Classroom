                <p class="mb-2">An <strong>independent clause</strong> is a complete thought that can stand alone as a sentence. Both clauses joined by a semicolon must be independent.</p>

                    Sentence 2 is more fluid. The semicolon shows a strong, direct connection between the two ideas (cause and effect), making the writing more sophisticated than two separate sentences.

                    <p class="mt-1">Use a semicolon to join two complete sentences that are closely related in thought. It's stronger than a comma but weaker than a period.</p>

                    <p class="mt-1">Use a semicolon to separate items in a list when the items themselves contain commas. This prevents confusion.</p>
