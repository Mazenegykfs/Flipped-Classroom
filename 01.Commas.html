                <p class="mb-2">A <strong>comma (,)</strong> is a punctuation mark that indicates a brief pause in a sentence. It helps to separate ideas, phrases, and clauses, making sentences easier to read and understand.</p>

                    Sentence 1 implies that both the engineers and managers must be experienced. Sentence 2 could imply that the engineers must be experienced, but the managers might not be. Commas clarify meaning!

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">4. Presentation: Four Key Comma Rules</h2>
            <div class="space-y-6">
                <!-- Rule 1 -->
                 <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Rule 1: Commas in a Series</h3>
                    <p class="mt-1">Use commas to separate three or more words, phrases, or clauses in a list.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 p-3 bg-gray-100 rounded-md"><b>Example:</b> The design requires steel<span class="font-bold text-blue-700">,</span> copper<span class="font-bold text-blue-700">,</span> and aluminum.</p>
                    <p class="mt-1"><small>Note: The final comma before 'and' is called the Oxford or serial comma. In technical writing, it is highly recommended to prevent ambiguity.</small></p>
                </div>
                <!-- Rule 2 -->
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Rule 2: Comma Before a Coordinating Conjunction</h3>
                    <p class="mt-1">Use a comma before a coordinating conjunction (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) when it joins two independent clauses.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 p-3 bg-gray-100 rounded-md"><b>Example:</b> The test results were positive<span class="font-bold text-blue-700">,</span> but the team decided to run a second verification.</p>
                </div>
                <!-- Rule 3 -->
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Rule 3: Comma After an Introductory Element</h3>
                    <p class="mt-1">Use a comma to separate an introductory word, phrase, or clause from the main clause of the sentence.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 p-3 bg-gray-100 rounded-md"><b>Example:</b> After analyzing the data<span class="font-bold text-blue-700">,</span> the engineers identified the primary fault.</p>
                </div>
                <!-- Rule 4 -->
                <div>
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">Rule 4: Commas with Non-Essential Elements</h3>
                    <p class="mt-1">Use a pair of commas to set off clauses, phrases, and words that are not essential to the meaning of the sentence.</p>
                    <p class="mt-2 p-3 bg-gray-100 rounded-md"><b>Example:</b> The main turbine<span class="font-bold text-blue-700">,</span> which was recently serviced<span class="font-bold text-blue-700">,</span> is operating at peak efficiency.</p>
